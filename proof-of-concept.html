<h2>Sale 1</h2>
Let's say you have 2 operations, the loots of which are still waiting to be sold. Here's the breakdown of the operations: (keeping it to 3 loots, numbers totally made up)
<pre>
Op 1:
	Phase 1 participants: Sable, Hal, Will
		Melted Nanoribbons: 32
		Sleeper Data Libray: 33
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 19
		
	Phase 1 participants: Sable, Will, Torvix
		Melted Nanoribbons: 49
		Sleeper Data Libray: 100
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 36
Op 2:		
	Phase 1 participants: Hal, Will
		Melted Nanoribbons: 29
		Sleeper Data Libray: 50
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 19
		
	Phase 1 participants: Torvix, Hal
		Melted Nanoribbons: 53
		Sleeper Data Libray: 153
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 100
		
	Phase 1 participants: Will (solo'd)
		Melted Nanoribbons: 14
		Sleeper Data Libray: 13
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 20
</pre>	
At the end of the operation, the loot is dumped into one big pile.
<pre>
Total:
 		Melted Nanoribbons: 177
		Sleeper Data Libray: 349
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 199
</pre>	
Seller then goes to Jita or whatever and sells it at these prices:
<pre>
	 	Melted Nanoribbons: 5.8 mil
		Sleeper Data Libray: 200,000 (NPC)
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 5 mil (NPC)
	</pre>
Which means the loot earns this:
<pre>
		Melted Nanoribbons: 1,026,600,000
		Sleeper Data Libray: 69,800,000
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 995,000,000
		TOTAL: 2,091,400,000
</pre>

The only thing the seller has to do is input how much each stack of loot sold for. The script will do all the calculations and make it easy.<br /><br />
(a certain percentage can be cut from each loot type that goes to corp costs (POS fuel, etc.) This can be fine-tuned to maximize profits for players but also leave a bit of buffer for the corp so it doesn't just break even. For this example, there is no corp tax)
<br /><br />

Break down the operations' loot into percentage, and distribute the total earned for that loot based on that percentage:
<pre>
Op 1:
	Phase 1 participants: Sable, Hal, Will
		Melted Nanoribbons: 33 (18.644%) = 191,399,304 (percentage of MNR profits)
		Sleeper Data Libray: 33 (9.456%) = 6,600,288
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 19 (9.548%) = 95,002,600
		
		TOTAL: 293,002,192
		Per member: 97,667,397
		
	Phase 1 participants: Sable, Will, Torvix
		Melted Nanoribbons: 49 (27.684%) = 284,203,944
		Sleeper Data Libray: 100 (28.653%) = 19,999,794
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 36 (18.090%) = 80,495,500
		
		TOTAL: 384,699,238
		Per member: 128,233,079
Op 2:		
	Phase 1 participants: Hal, Will
		Melted Nanoribbons: 29 (16.384%) = 168,198,144
		Sleeper Data Libray: 50 (14.327%) = 10,000,246
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 19 (9.548%) = 95,002,600
		
		TOTAL: 187,698,650
		Per member: 93,849,325
		
	Phase 1 participants: Torvix, Hal
		Melted Nanoribbons: 53 (29.944%) = 307,405,104
		Sleeper Data Libray: 153 (43.840%) = 30,600,320
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 100 (50.251%) = 499,997,450
		
		TOTAL: 838,002,874
		Per member: 419,001,437
		
	Phase 1 participants: Will (solo'd)
		Melted Nanoribbons: 14 (7.910%) = 81,204,060
		Sleeper Data Libray: 13 (3.725%) = 2,600,050
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 20 (10.050%) = 99,997,500
		
		TOTAL: 183,801,610
		Per member: 183,801,610
</pre>	

For each member in operation phases, the script will add the "Per member" value to their balance. Display a page that has a link to each of their show info boxs and the amount of ISK they are due to make it easier for the seller to distribute the earnings.
<br /><br />
Any pocket change left due the significant figures in percentages and rounding down will be kept by the corp.
