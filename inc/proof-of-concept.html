<h2>Sale 1 Example</h2>
Let's say you have 2 operations, the loots of which are still waiting to be sold. Here's the breakdown of the operations: (keeping it to 3 loots, numbers totally made up)
<pre>
Op 1:
	Phase 1 participants: Sable, Hal, Will
		Melted Nanoribbons: 32
		Sleeper Data Libray: 33
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 24
		
	Phase 2 participants: Sable, Will, Torvix
		Melted Nanoribbons: 49
		Sleeper Data Libray: 100
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 36
Op 2:		
	Phase 1 participants: Hal, Will
		Melted Nanoribbons: 29
		Sleeper Data Libray: 50
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 19
		
	Phase 2 participants: Torvix, Hal
		Melted Nanoribbons: 53
		Sleeper Data Libray: 153
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 100
		
	Phase 3 participants: Will (solo'd)
		Melted Nanoribbons: 14
		Sleeper Data Libray: 13
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 20
</pre>	
At the end of the operation, the loot is dumped into one big pile.
<pre>
Total:
 		Melted Nanoribbons: 177
		Sleeper Data Libray: 349
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 199
</pre>	
Seller then goes to Jita or whatever and sells it at these prices:
<pre>
	 	Melted Nanoribbons: 5.8 mil
		Sleeper Data Libray: 200,000 (NPC)
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 5 mil (NPC)
	</pre>
Which means the loot earns this:
<pre>
		Melted Nanoribbons: 1,026,600,000
		Sleeper Data Libray: 69,800,000
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 995,000,000
		TOTAL: 2,091,400,000
</pre>

The only thing the seller has to do is input how much each stack of loot sold for. The script will do all the calculations and make it easy.<br /><br />
(a certain percentage can be cut from each loot type that goes to corp costs (POS fuel, etc.) This can be fine-tuned to maximize profits for players but also leave a bit of buffer for the corp so it doesn't just break even. For this example, there is no corp tax)
<br /><br />
Break down the operations' loot into percentage, and distribute the total earned for that loot based on that percentage:
<br /><br />
Also note that the percentages are truncated to 2 decimals numbers via the database calculations. .07910 would be truncated to .07, which translates to 7%. Whatever left over ISK the produces will be given to corp (or can be kept by the seller if that's the corps policy.) This truncation can be changed to include more precision.

Op 1:
	Phase 1 participants: Sable, Hal, Will
		Melted Nanoribbons: 33 (18%) = 184,788,000 (percentage of MNR profits)

		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 36 (18%) = 179,100,000
		
		TOTAL: 475,826,000
		Per member: 158,608,666
Op 2:		
	Phase 1 participants: Hal, Will
		Melted Nanoribbons: 29 (16%) = 164,256,000
		Sleeper Data Libray: 50 (14%) = 9,772,000
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 19 (9%) = 89,550,000
		
		TOTAL: 263,578,000

		Sleeper Data Libray: 153 (43%) = 30,014,000
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 100 (50%) = 497,500,000
		
		TOTAL: 825,215,000
		Per member: 412,607,500
		
	Phase 3 participants: Will (solo'd)
		Melted Nanoribbons: 14 (7%) = 71,862,000
		Sleeper Data Libray: 13 (3%) = 2,094,000
		Sleeper Drone A.I.: 20 (10%) = 99,500,000
		
		TOTAL: 173,456,000
		Per member: 173,456,000

For each member in operation phases, the script will add the "Per member" value to their balance. Display a page that has a link to each of their show info boxs and the amount of ISK they are due to make it easier for the seller to distribute the earnings.
<br /><br />
Any pocket change left due to rounding precision in percentages will be kept by the corp. Any 0.xx ISK calculated is truncated, and will be kept by corp.
