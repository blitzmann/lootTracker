Install:

- Run inc/lootTracker.sql to build database tables.
- Run memberRefresh.php to fetch member list. This needs to run on a regular basis to keep up-to-date
- Open _.php and edit any configs you need (site name, tax, etc...)

Should be done after that. I'll write up a more complete README later...
